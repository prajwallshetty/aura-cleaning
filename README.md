# Aura Laundry ERP

A production laundry operating system built around the only chain that matters on a
laundry floor:

```
Order → Garment → Processing → Location → Delivery → Payment
```

Every piece of clothing that comes through the door gets its own identity, its own
QR/barcode tag and its own immutable history. The system can always answer the
question a counter gets asked twenty times a day — **"where is my shirt right now?"**

## What this is

This is not a generic ERP with a laundry skin. The data model and the screens are
shaped by how a laundry actually runs:

- **The garment is the unit of work**, not the order. An order with six shirts is six
  tracked garments, each with its own tag, its own pipeline and its own ledger.
- **The order is only as far along as its slowest garment.** Order status is derived
  from where the garments physically are, never set by hand and hoped for.
- **Storage is physical.** A packed order lives in Branch → Rack → Slot, and searching
  an order or garment code returns that location immediately.
- **Everything is branch-scoped.** Multi-branch is not a later migration; every
  operational record carries a `branchId` from day one.

Deliberately **not** built, per the brief: machine management, and a separate
customer/CRM module. Customer details live on the order, where billing, pickup and
delivery actually need them.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui component patterns, Lucide icons |
| Data | PostgreSQL + Prisma 7 (driver adapter, `prisma-client` generator) |
| Auth | Auth.js / NextAuth v5 (credentials) with database-backed RBAC |
| Validation | Zod on every server action and route handler |
| Charts | Recharts, on a CVD-validated categorical palette |
| Files | S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 / Supabase) |
| Payments | Provider-abstracted — manual counter and Razorpay included |
| Messaging | WhatsApp Cloud API, SMS, email — all behind one transport interface |

Server Components do the data work; Client Components appear only where there is
real interactivity (scanners, forms, charts, dialogs).

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 14+

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
#    Set DATABASE_URL and AUTH_SECRET at minimum.
#    Generate a secret with: openssl rand -base64 32

# 3. Create the schema
npx prisma migrate deploy      # or: npm run db:migrate  (development)

# 4. Load demo data
npm run db:seed

# 5. Run
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in with any account below.

### Useful scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Generate the Prisma client and build for production |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` across the project |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Create and apply a migration |
| `npm run db:deploy` | Apply migrations (production) |
| `npm run db:seed` | Re-seed demo data (clears transactional tables first) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Prisma Studio |

---

## Demo accounts

All demo accounts share the password **`Aura@Laundry1`**.

| Email | Role | What they see |
|---|---|---|
| `superadmin@auralaundry.example` | Super Admin | Everything, including settings and audit |
| `owner@auralaundry.example` | Owner | Everything across all branches |
| `manager@auralaundry.example` | Branch Manager | One branch, end to end |
| `counter@auralaundry.example` | Counter Staff | Booking, billing, garment lookup |
| `washing@auralaundry.example` | Washing Staff | Sorting, washing and drying stations |
| `ironing@auralaundry.example` | Ironing Staff | Ironing station |
| `qc@auralaundry.example` | QC Staff | Quality control, raising complaints |
| `packing@auralaundry.example` | Packing Staff | Packing station and rack filing |
| `driver@auralaundry.example` | Driver | Only their own pickups and deliveries |
| `accountant@auralaundry.example` | Accountant | Billing, purchases, expenses, reports |

Signing in as the washing staff account and opening `/billing` is the quickest way to
see the authorisation layer work.

## Architecture

### The order lifecycle

```
Received → Sorting → Washing → Drying → Ironing → Quality Check
        → Packing → Ready → Out for Delivery → Delivered
```

With first-class support for partial delivery, cancellation, refund, rewash, rework
and failed delivery.

### How a garment moves

1. **Intake.** Booking an order creates one `Garment` per physical piece, each with a
   unique code (`G1001`), a QR payload and a CODE128 barcode. It also creates that
   garment's `ProcessingTask` pipeline, derived from the stages configured on its
   service — a steam-iron order never queues at the washing station.
2. **Stations.** Each workstation shows only the garments it can actually action:
   a task whose earlier stages are still open is counted, not listed. An operator
   scans, picks an outcome, and the system advances the task, appends to the
   garment's immutable ledger, opens the next stage and re-derives the parent order's
   status — all in one transaction.
3. **Remediation.** A QC failure routes the garment back to washing and reopens every
   downstream stage. Rewash and rework increment their own counters, which feed the
   operations report.
4. **Storage.** Packing files the garment into a rack slot; that is the moment it
   becomes `READY`. The move is written to `GarmentLocationHistory`.
5. **Handover.** Dispatch marks garments out for delivery; completing the delivery
   hands them over, releases the rack slot, books any cash collected at the door and
   closes the order.

### Where state lives

The order header is a **derived** view of its garments, recomputed by
`recomputeOrderStatus` on every shop-floor event. An order sits at the station its
least-advanced garment is queued at. Money is derived the same way:
`recalcOrderPayments` re-reads captured payments and processed refunds rather than
trusting an incrementally maintained balance.

Two tables are append-only by contract:

- `GarmentStatusHistory` — every status change a garment has ever had
- `GarmentLocationHistory` — every physical move

## Roles and permissions

Ten roles ship out of the box. Authorisation is **permission-based, not role-based** —
every server action authorises against a permission code such as `orders.cancel` or
`processing.qc`, so access can be tuned per person without inventing new roles.

Effective access is:

```
role defaults  ∪  per-user grants  ∖  per-user revocations
```

Role defaults live in `src/lib/rbac.ts` and are seeded into `RolePermission`.
Overrides live in `UserPermission` and are editable from a staff member's profile.
A manager can never grant a permission they do not themselves hold, and only a super
admin can mint another super admin or owner.

Branch scoping is enforced separately and independently: `assertBranchAccess` and
`requireWriteBranch` pin non-global roles to their own branch regardless of what the
request asks for.

---

## Integrations

All three integration surfaces are interfaces with a working default, so a provider
can be swapped without touching feature code.

**Object storage** (`src/lib/providers/storage.ts`)
`STORAGE_DRIVER=local` writes to `./uploads` behind an authenticated route; `s3`,
`r2` and `supabase` all speak the S3 API. Uploads are type- and size-checked, and
keys are always server-generated — a client filename never reaches the bucket.

**Payments** (`src/lib/providers/payments.ts`)
`manual` covers cash, UPI on a static QR and card machines. `razorpay` creates orders
server-side and verifies the callback signature with a timing-safe comparison; a
webhook verifier is included. Credentials never leave the server — the browser only
ever sees the public key and an order id. `buildUpiIntentUri` generates a dynamic UPI
QR for the exact amount.

**Notifications** (`src/lib/providers/notifications.ts`)
WhatsApp Cloud API, a Twilio-shaped SMS gateway and transactional email. Templates
are database-backed with `{{placeholder}}` substitution and a built-in fallback.
`NOTIFICATIONS_DRIVER=log` prints to the server log so development never sends real
messages. Delivery failures never roll back the business operation that triggered
them; each attempt is recorded in `NotificationLog`.

---

## Security

- **Authentication** — Auth.js credentials with bcrypt (cost 12) and a constant-work
  comparison so response timing does not reveal which accounts exist.
- **Authorisation** — checked server-side on every action and route handler. The
  middleware only checks that a session exists; it is never the security boundary.
- **Branch isolation** — enforced on both reads and writes.
- **Input validation** — Zod schemas on every mutation; errors come back as typed
  field errors rather than exceptions.
- **Audit logging** — every create, update and delete writes an `AuditLog` entry with
  actor, branch, before/after snapshots, IP and user agent. Secrets are redacted
  before anything is written.
- **Rate limiting** — on login (by IP *and* by account), scanning, mutations, uploads
  and report exports.
- **Uploads** — MIME and size allow-lists, server-generated keys, path-traversal
  guards, and `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` on the local file route.
- **CSV export** — RFC 4180 quoting plus a formula-injection guard.
- **Database constraints** — foreign keys, unique constraints and indexes do the work
  the application layer should not be trusted with alone.
- **Secrets** — server-only environment variables. `src/lib/providers/*` are all
  marked `server-only`, so an accidental client import is a build error rather than a
  leak.

---

## Deployment

**Recommended:** Vercel + a managed PostgreSQL (Neon, Supabase, RDS) + S3/R2.

1. Push to GitHub and import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the environment variables from `.env.example`. At minimum: `DATABASE_URL`,
   `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`.
3. Point `STORAGE_DRIVER` at real object storage — the `local` driver writes to the
   instance's filesystem and will not survive a deploy.
4. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` against the production database as part of your
   release step.
5. Create the first Super Admin. The simplest route is to run the seed once against a
   fresh database and then change that account's password and email — or insert a user
   directly with a bcrypt hash.

The build runs `prisma generate` first, so a cold CI cache is fine.

```

Each feature folder keeps its `actions.ts` (server actions) next to the pages that
use them, so a module is legible in one place.
